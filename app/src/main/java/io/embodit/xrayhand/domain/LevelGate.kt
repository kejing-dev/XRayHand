/**
 * D9 for the system main window (factory native-window-move §7.9, ported from sign-hands v0.1.5): the system opens a
 * Planar window on the line of sight and square to it, head pitch included, and SDK 6.1 has no call to read or set a window's pose
 * (`volumeAlignment` is Volumetric only, `windowConstraints` is size only). So the app asks for the window only while
 * the head is level: |pitch| <= [maxPitchDeg] held for [dwellMs]. Until then the Stage shows "平视前方". When the
 * frames keep coming without a valid head pose for [noHeadMs] the window is opened anyway (a window is better than
 * none); that time counts from the first such frame, not from the ask (the Stage's frames start ~6 s after launch on
 * the headset, the ask comes at once).
 *
 * Pure: the caller feeds the time and the head pitch every frame; [step] says when to open.
