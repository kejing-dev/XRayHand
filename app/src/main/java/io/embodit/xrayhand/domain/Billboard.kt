/**
 * The 3D label plates (bone labels; taste profile D10): a quad in its
 * local XY plane whose front is +Z, turned about the vertical only so it faces the viewer, never pitched,
 * never mirrored.
 *
 * 0.1.0 drew every plate upside down (headset feedback 2026-10-26, "dark coffee table" unreadable): the
 * engine samples a bitmap with v = 0 at its bottom row (Sky Dome QA q1-2 found the same), while the quad
 * gave its top edge v = 0. The corner UVs below are written for the engine's convention, and
 * [BillboardTest] checks the whole chain: yaw-only, front to the viewer, +X to the viewer's right, the
 * bitmap's top row on top and its left column on the left.
